# GTD
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland and makes the GTD available online in an effort to increase understanding of terrorist violence so that it can be more readily studied and defeated

# Problem Statement 
The aim of this project is to put forth analysis and visualisation of the Global terrorism events to interpret occurrences of terrorist activities.

# Data Collection Methodology 

(a)	The ongoing collection has made significant improvements to the methodology used to compile the database since Apr 2012, balancing the strengths of artificial and human intelligence. The process begins with a more diverse set of news media sources from around the world for identifying and documenting the incidents that are included in the GTD—more than two million articles published daily. Natural language processing, named entity extraction, and machine learning models facilitate the identification and organization of news articles that include information about terrorist attacks. The GTD team developed a proprietary Data Management System that allows analysts to identify unique attacks, record the details of each event, and update records for previously recorded events as new information becomes available.

(b)	Key factors that impact the content of datasets like the GTD include definitions, sources, and workflows. While the GTD team has applied a single definition of terrorism over the full span of the database, access to source materials and the efficiency of workflows have varied over time. For example, the availability of source materials was best at times when the data collection had the shortest lag behind real time. Improvements in technology and the expansion of the internet have enhanced both the accessibility of source materials and the efficiency of workflows. In general, users should interpret trends over time with caution. In particular, differences in levels of attacks and casualties before and after January 1, 1998; April 1, 2008; and January 1, 2012 may be partially explained by shifts in data collection. Likewise, the GTD is not directly comparable to other sources of data on terrorism, as differences in definitions, sources, and workflows will produce misleading inferences.


# Data Preprocessing

Of the 165 fields in the database, there were many which did not have data in most or all the records. There were 70 such fields. These fields were removed. The list of these fields and the number of absent records is placed at Appendix A. The remaining data was studied to explore the methods of analysis and visualisation.  


# Visualisation

(a)	Visualisation was broadly divided into two categories – World and India. Data on terrorism was represented for these categories. The variables for which visualisation was prepared are the time duration, success/failure of attacks, selection of worldwide zones, Types of attacks, Methods /Weapons used and Terrorist groups. 

(b)	The visualisations were organized into dashboards and presented in a manner which would augur logical deductions. Screenshots of the dashboards are given in the subsequent paragraphs.
